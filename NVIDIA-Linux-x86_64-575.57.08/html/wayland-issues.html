<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>There are several areas in which the NVIDIA driver lacks feature
parity between X11 and Wayland. These may be due to limitations of
the driver itself, the Wayland protocol, or the specific Wayland
compositor in use. Over time this list is expected to shorten as
missing functionality is implemented both in the driver and in
upstream components, but the following captures the situation as of
the release of this driver version. Note that this assumes a
compositor with reasonably complete support for graphics-related
Wayland protocol extensions.</p>
<h3>NVIDIA Driver Limitations</h3>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Wayland compositors may not be designed to handle the case where
two DRM drivers instantiate independent device nodes capable of
driving the same display. When the nvidia-drm driver does not
remove conflicting framebuffers and instantiate its own DRM fbdev
support, simpledrm will remain present for driving the initial
framebuffer console if initially loaded. In this situation, both
simpledrm and nvidia-drm have DRI device nodes driving the same
display. This can lead to issues such as a black screen,
corruption, or flickering. A workaround for this is to set the
fbdev=1 module parameter for the nvidia-drm kernel module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The NvFBC desktop capture library does not have native Wayland
support and does not work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nvidia-drm module does support the DEGAMMA_LUT, CTM, and
GAMMA_LUT CRTC properties. However the COLOR_ENCODING and
COLOR_RANGE plane properties are unsupported. This may impact some
advanced compositor features related to color correction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The nvidia-settings configuration tool has limited functionality
on Wayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Front-buffer rendering in GLX does not work with Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explicit Sync refers to using DRM Syncobj timeline
synchronization points to explicitly signal ownership transfers of
shared buffers to and from the compositor. Explicit Sync support
requires a kernel that contains the following two commits, which
fix bugs preventing Explicit Sync from working correctly. These are
present in 6.8.x or newer kernels.</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="circle">
<li>
<p>"drm/syncobj: fix DRM_SYNCOBJ_WAIT_FLAGS_WAIT_AVAILABLE" with
commit hash 101c9f637efa1655f55876644d4439e552267527.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"drm/syncobj: handle NULL fence in syncobj_eventfd_entry_func"
with commit hash 2aa6f5b0fd052e363bb9d4b547189f0bf6b3d6d3.</p>

<h3>Wayland Protocol or Compositor Limitations</h3>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>The following workstation features are not supported by any
Wayland compositors or the Wayland protocol. They will also likely
require new EGL extensions or other means to expose the related
hardware functionality. Features followed by an asterisk (*) are
supported with VK_KHR_display.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>There is no established public API through which Wayland
compositors can power off video memory via RTD3 (<a href=
"dynamicpowermanagement.html" title=
"Chapter&nbsp;22.&nbsp;PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management">Chapter&nbsp;22,
<i>PCI-Express Runtime D3 (RTD3) Power Management</i></a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Display multiplexers (muxes) are typically used in laptops with
both integrated and discrete GPUs to provide a direct connection
between the discrete GPU and the built-in display (internal mux) or
an external display (external mux). On X11, the display mux can be
automatically switched when a full-screen application is running on
the discrete GPU, enabling enhanced display features and improved
performance, but no Wayland compositors currently support this
functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indirect GLX is not supported by Xwayland.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware overlays cannot be used by GLX applications with
Xwayland.</p>
